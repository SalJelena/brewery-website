# Description and functionalities
This website is created as a promotion for imaginary Brewery recipes and webshop. it Contains some beer recipes, brewer's tips and database of different kinds of beer flavours.
My vision was that it connects community by enabling anyone who creates account to post their own recipe and comb trough others'. So, a user can create an account (register) and then log in. After that, user can go trough beer recipes, sort them by their type and post some new recipes.

Website is still not complete. Some functionalities will be added in near future.

# TO DO
1. Add style to forms.
2. Add input types to comb thorugh beer recipes.
3. Add styles to front page.
4. Add logout button.
5. Make server available online without running it previously.
6. Making the website responsive.
